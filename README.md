# Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
Customer Churn Analysis :
        This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to understand why customers leave (churn) and identifying key factors that influence churn. It includes data cleaning, 
        exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling for churn prediction.
        
Project Objectives
  Analyze customer patterns to understand churn drivers
  Build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn
  Visualize insights for business decision-making
  Provide recommendations to reduce churn

Data Preprocessing : 
  Handled missing values
  Encoded categorical variables
  Removed duplicates

Exploratory Data Analysis

  Key insights explored:
    Churn distribution
    Tenure and churn relationship
    Contract type vs churn
    Charges and churn
    Demographic patterns
    
Visuals created using Python and Power BI.

Machine Learning
    Trained model using Random Forest

Evaluated using:
    Accuracy
    Precision
    Recall

Power BI Dashboard

Interactive dashboard includes:
    Total churn rate
    Churn by demographics
    Churn by contract
    Monthly charges impact
    Business recommendations

Key Findings
  Month-to-month customers churn the most
  High charges increase churn probability
  Low-tenure customers are at highest risk
  Customers without tech support churn more
